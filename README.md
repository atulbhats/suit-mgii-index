SUIT Mg II index generation code

Magnesium II index is defined as the Ratio of the Mg II h & k, core to wing ratio. 

Mg II index was first defined by [Heath and Schlesinger (1986)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986JGR....91.8672H) as :

$$P_{MgII}  = \big(\frac{4}{3}\big) \frac{ I_ {279.8} +  I_ {280.0} +  I_ {280.2}}{ I_ {276.6} + I_ {276.8} +  I_ {283.2} + I_ {283.4}}$$

where the $I_{\lambda}$ are the intensities of the various wavelengths (nm) of the Mg II h & k core and wing lines. 

With 4 of [SUIT](https://suit.iucaa.in/)'s filters observing the Sun around Mg II lines, we calculate the Mg II index according to the various Filter Wavelengths of SUIT. 

<!-- #NB4	(280.3nm),	NB3	(279.6nm), NB2 (276.7nm) and NB5 (283.2nm) filters imaging the Sun's Full-Disk at Mg II h, Mg II k, Mg II k blue-wing, and Mg II h red-wing wavelengths, we (Megha Anand et al. -in preparation) define the Mg II index as

$$P_{MgII} = \frac{I_{280.3} + I_{279.6}}{I_{276.7} + I_{283.2}}$$ 

Using the above formula, we calculate the SUIT Mg II index -->
